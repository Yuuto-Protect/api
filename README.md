# Yuuto Protect API

This repository is used for the API of [Yuuto Protect](https://bots.yuuto.dev).

Before choosing Go for the API, I used Next.js (which is also used for the website itself).
The reason I switched to Go is that I wanted to learn Go and I wanted to use a language that is more performant and fast than JavaScript/TypeScript.
